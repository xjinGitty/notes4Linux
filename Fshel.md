1. env and set: for environment and the self-defined
2. export could help on this

4. declare: to define the type or undefine (- or +

5. ulimit: to limit para settings for current user

6. echo ${variable#/bin:}      ${variable##/*bin:}     ${varialbe$:*bin}     ${viarable$$:*bin}   ### this is the deletion in shell
7. the trying for 6 command is not usefull (???)

9. echo ${variable/sbin/SBIN} or ${variable//sbin/SBIN}  ### this is the replacement or replacement for all in shell
10. ${variable}  this is also the command for checking and set variable

-- stty and set to modify the terminal settings
-- wildcard and the specific key
-- cut and grep both for dealing with the line: one directly and another just print the line : tab is the default sep chara for cut

-- sort and cut: almost has the same command format
-- xargs: echo will be the default command following xargs if no specific is defined 

-- using the variable and the alias: if has the $ or $() or ``
-- config file and the shell script also has the same way differents   ??? should have the /bin/bash or not
-- source could be used to read config file, how about the scirpt???
-- shell exist for user between with the kernel and then could handle the hardware: hardw->kernel(driver)->shell<-user(app)
-- find / -name test > log 2>&1 or find / -name &>1   pipe all of the output to one single file
-- unset and unalias
