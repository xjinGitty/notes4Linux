1. shell script could be used as nimi-work 
--exit: for terminate program with a value: exit 0; then could be check via $?;  we also could define error info by ourself by using exit n
--in the script we need define the PATH env??

write at last when reviewed:
-- bash or the definitely path to execute script, new bash process is launched
-- when use source, will execute script in father shell

-- test []

-- shell script also has its $0 $1; function() has its own $0 ; the other is awk has its own $0
